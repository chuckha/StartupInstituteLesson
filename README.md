## Website cloning

Working together to clone an existing website.
Everyone will be following along and typing things out to get a feel for typing HTML and CSS.
We will be scrutinizing every element and discussing what our options are (e.g. should we use a div or a section tag?). 
Hopefully we will get the structure done with enough time for us to dive into CSS.

## Mobile first and media queries

Mobile-first practice.
Have a design/mockup for a phone and implement it with semantic HTML and organized CSS.
After the first page is done, stretch the window until the design looks bad.
This is where you will add a media query. 
Measure the size of the window and add a media query for this size.
Reorganize the content to look good in this new sized window. 
Repeat until you can't make the window any bigger.
