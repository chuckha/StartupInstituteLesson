# Activity for group 1

## Going over the Cafe Lab

We'll go over the cafe lab and do a bit of Q/A.
Then I thought it might be useful to see how I would approach the lab
and how I work when I develop a website. You can ask questions and ask me
about design decisions and things like that if it's useful. Or you can
just follow along.

If that's not useful, then I think having some time to get further along
on the lab while I wander around helping individuals could be useful.

# Activity for group 2

## Mobile first and media queries

Group two will be a bit more independantly focused. People can take a look
at the code in this repo and if they want to, use it as a base for a responsive
cafe shop site.

Sketch out a mobile design for the cafe shop and implement it.
After you implement the design for the smallest screen size, stretch your browser out until
the design looks ugly. Add a media query to introduce some new CSS and redesign the site.
Rinse and repeat until you get to the full-sized design.
